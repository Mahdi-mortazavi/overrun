/* ============================= MATCHMAKER ===============================

   One global Durable Object holding one table. It answers three questions and
   nothing else:

     • is ABC123 a real room, and what mode is it?
     • where do I put someone who pressed QUICKPLAY on tdm?
     • which rooms have gone quiet and can be forgotten?

   It never touches a simulation and never holds a socket, so it stays cheap
   and stays awake for milliseconds at a time. Every row here is a hint about
   a MatchRoom, not the truth: the room itself is authoritative and pushes its
   state here as it changes. A stale row costs a player one wasted join, which
   is much cheaper than waking every room in the world to ask.                */
