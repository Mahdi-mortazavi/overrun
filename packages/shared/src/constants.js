   Every balance number in OVERRUN lives here. Retune the whole game without

   the same numbers the browser does, so prediction and truth cannot drift. */

    /* Locomotion is friction-and-accelerate, not lerp-to-target.

       The difference is the whole feel of the game. Lerping toward a desired
       velocity gives movement that is instant in every direction equally —
       responsive, but weightless, because reversing costs exactly what
       continuing costs. Applying friction every frame and then accelerating
       only along the input direction means a reversal has to pay for the
       speed it already had. You feel the turn. Nothing about the response
       delay is artificial: input still bites on the first frame.

       accel must comfortably exceed speed * friction or top speed silently
       drops below `speed` — that relationship is the one thing to preserve
       when retuning these. */

       channel that is NOT clamped to top speed and decays on its own curve.

       every second it closes by `bloomRecover` radians flat. A weapon only
       blooms if it fires fast enough to outrun the recovery — so the SMG at
       12 rounds/s reaches its ceiling in about a second of held fire, while
       the breacher at 1.7 rounds/s never blooms at all, which is right: you
       do not spray a shotgun.

       Set recovery too high relative to the per-shot gain and bloom silently
       does nothing whatsoever, which is exactly what the first tuning of this
       did — the numbers looked reasonable in isolation and were an order of
